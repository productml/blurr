# in which the offer is shown is the anchor
Anchor:
  Condition:  source.game_stats.offer_type != ''
  # Max defines the maximum number of output rows to be generated every time the Window DTC is run
  # We expect the Window DTC is run periodically (perhaps daily) to generate training data
  # By setting max = 1, we're making sure that we are only selecting one session for each user
  # in each period the Window DTC is run. This is to avoid over-sampling more active users
  Max: 1
