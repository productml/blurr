Type: Blurr:Transform:Streaming
Version: '2018-03-01'
Description: Generate sessions from streaming Raw Data
Name: offer_ai_v1

# The field in the raw data around which data is aggregated. This is usually a unique user id
Identity: source.customer_identifier

Time: parser.parse(source.event_time) #This tells the DTC that source.event_time is time of the source event

# The raw data is converted to sessions and stored in persistent storage such as DynamoDB (a Store)
# Store properties. Only DynamoDB is supported currently
Stores:

 - Type: Blurr:Store:MemoryStore
   Name: offer_ai

Aggregates:

   # IdentityAggregate is meant for user profile information that is rarely updated. This is processed first
   # These are things like country, install source and whether user is logged in to Facebook
 - Type: Blurr:Aggregate:IdentityAggregate
   Name: user
   Store: offer_ai
   When: source.event_id in ['app_launched', 'user_updated']

   # BlockAggregates definition
 - Type: Blurr:Aggregate:BlockAggregate
   Name: game_stats
   # We defined this store earlier
   Store: offer_ai
