# Type of DTC. Streaming or Window
# The Streaming DTC processes the raw data and converts it into sessions

Type: Blurr:Streaming
Version: '2018-03-01'
Description: Level 1 transformation from streaming Raw Data
Name: fbt_v1

# The field in the raw data around which data is aggregated. This is usually a unique user id

Identity: source.appInstanceId
Time: parser.parse(source.start_time) #This tells the DTC that source.start_time is time of the source event

##
# The raw data is converted to sessions and stored in persistent storage such as DynamoDB (a Store)
# Store properties. Only DynamoDB is supported currently
##

Stores:
   - Type: Blurr:Store:MemoryStore
     Name: 

Aggregates:

 - Type: Blurr:Aggregate:IdentityAggregate
   Name: user
   Store: fbt_v1_dynamo
   When: source.event_name = 'session_start'

   Fields:
     - Name: appInstanceId
       Value: source.appInstanceId

   Fields:
     - Name: age
       Value: source.age

    Fields:
     - Name: gender

    Fields:
     - Name: install_date
       Type: datetime
       Value: time
       # time is defined above as the start time of the event
       When: user.time > time
       # This field only gets updated if the current field (user.time)
       # is later than the time of the event being processed, so user.time will
       # always be the first event that was seen for the user


    Fields:
     - Name: days_since_install
       Value: (time - user.time).days
