SourceDTC: fbt_v1

# Anchor defines the condition used to trigger the decision
# If the user view a primary product in this session, every session
# where this product is shown becomes an anchor

Anchor:

  Condition:  fbt_v1.item_stats.transaction_value_this_session > 0
  # Max defines the maximum number of output rows to be generated every time the Window DTC is run
  # We expect the Window DTC is run periodically (perhaps daily) to generate training data
  # By setting max = 1, we're making sure that we are only selecting one transaction for each user
  # in each period the Window DTC is run. This is to avoid over-sampling more active users
  # We're free to change this the max value to whatever we want, of course
  Max: 1
