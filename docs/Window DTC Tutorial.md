# Tutorial 2: Window Aggregation

In this tutorial we'll introduce a new type of DTC: the __Window DTC__, and will learn how a Window DTC consumes session data produced in the first tutorial in order to generate __time aggregated data__.


## 1. Game Boosts

For this second tutorial we'll introduce the concept of __boosts__ to the game we defined previously.

In order to make the game more exciting a user can now activate a __boost__ when starting a play session. While the boost is active, games become easier. Chances of winning a game are increased.

When the player activates a boost, the `game_start` event will include a `"boost": true` property:

```json
{ "user_id": "09C1", "session_id": "T8KA", "country" : "UK", "event_id": "game_start", "boost" : true, "timestamp" : "2018/03/04 08:32:12" }
```

There are a couple of restrictions with boosts though:

* A player can activate a boost only once.
* The boost will be active for just 3 days.

We expect our players will be encouraged to play more often during the next 3 days after activating the boost.

The goal of this tutorial is to __collect aggregated session data__ that __validates our assumption__.


## 2. Aggregation Result

In order to confirm our hypothesis we're interested in comparing two figures:

1. The average number of games played by session __before activating the boost__
1. The average number of games played by session __while the boost is active__

We will obtain this data by aggregating the __original session data__ obtained in the first tutorial into an series of records containing the desired information:

| user_id  | last_7_days.avg_games_per_session | next_3_days.avg_games_per_session |
| -------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 09C1     | 4.82                              | 5.61                              |
| B6FA     | 2.73                              | 3.09                              |
| NV9T     | 8.11                              | 12.52                             |
| 6CF3     | 9.89                              | 14.74                             |

This result shows our players have increased the games played per session after activating the boost.

## 3. Window DTC

In order to obtain the output described before, Blurr will perform __time-based aggregation__ over the historic session data obtained with the Streaming DTC in the first tutorial. This transformation is defined in a __Window DTC__:

```yaml
Type: Blurr:DTC:Window
Version: '2018-03-01'
Name: boost_data

SourceDTC: sessions

Anchor:
  Condition: source.event_id == "game_start" and source.boost == True

DataGroups:
  - Type: Blurr:DTC:DataGroup:AnchorAggregate
    Name: last_7_days
    Window:
      Type: day
      Value: -7
      Source: sessions.session_stats

    Fields:
     - Name: avg_games_per_session
       Type: float
       Value: sum(source.games_played) / len(source.session_id)

  - Type: Blurr:DTC:DataGroup:AnchorAggregate
    Name: next_3_days
    Window:
      Type: day
      Value: +3
      Source: sessions.session_stats

    Fields:
     - Name: avg_games_per_session
       Type: float
       Value: sum(source.games_played) / len(source.session_id)
```

As we can see, the structure of a Window DTC is pretty similar to the Streaming DTC. There are 2 new elements though: `SourceDTC` and `Anchor`

### 3.1. SourceDTC

As we mentioned before, a Window DTC will use session data produced by a Streaming DTC as __data input__. This is indicated in `SourceDTC`:

```yaml
SourceDTC: sessions
```

`sessions` is the `Name` given to the Streaming DTC in its header:

```yaml
# excerpt from Streaming DTC
Type: Blurr:DTC:Streaming
Version: '2018-03-07'
Name : sessions
```

### 3.2. Anchor Points

In time-based aggregations, data is aggregated around __Anchor Points__. This a key concept in time-based transformations. In our example, an Anchor Point is __the session in which the boost is activated__ for a user:

```yaml
Anchor:
  Condition: source.event_id == "game_start" and source.boost == True
```

As in Streaming DTCs, `source` keyword is used to access the properties of the object being processed.


### 3.3. Identity

It's time to bring back the concept of Identity introduced in the previous tutorial:

```yaml
# excerpt from Streaming DTC
Identity: source.user_id
```

So far, we've thought of the Identity as a mandatory field that is part of both the original events and session data.

In a Window DTC the Identity also has a role: __grouping data__ that is aggregated around Anchor Points. The Identity ensures that our output has __one record per user__.


### 3.4. Anchor Aggregates

Our Window DTC performs 2 different aggregations:

* Over all sessions 7 days __before__ the Anchor Point.
* Over all sessions 3 days __before__ the Anchor Point.

How each aggregated is calculated is defined by `AnchorAggregate` DataGroups:


```yaml
- Type: Blurr:DTC:DataGroup:AnchorAggregate
    Name: last_7_days
    Window:
      Type: day
      Value: -7
      Source: sessions.session_stats

    Fields:
     - Name: avg_games_per_session
       Type: float
       Value: sum(source.games_played) / len(source.session_id)
```

This `AnchorAggregate` is responsible of aggregating data for the __previous 7 days__ before the boost activation.

#### Window

The `Window` element defines the time window for the aggregation.

```yaml
Type: day
Value: -7
  Source: sessions.session_stats
```

`Type` and `Value` are used to indicate the how many days/hours of data from/since the Anchor Point are being collected:

`Source` is used to __lookup input data__ from the Streaming DTC.

In this case the input is session data produced in `session_stats` DataGroup in `sessions` Streaming DTC:

```yaml
# excerpt from Streaming DTC
DataGroups:
 - Type: Blurr:DTC:DataGroup:BlockAggregate
   Name: session_stats
```


#### Fields

Data is aggregated using the `Value` expression of a `Field`:

```yaml
Fields:
  - Name: avg_games_per_session
    Type: float
    Value: sum(source.games_played) / len(source.session_id)

```

We're interested in the name of games played by session, which is the result of dividing the number of games played in all sessions by the number of sessions:

```
avg_games_by_session = total_games_played_count / session_count
```

This is calculated with the following Python expression:

```yaml
Value: sum(source.games_played) / len(source.session_id)
```

It's important to note that in context, `source` __is not__ a list of sessions, but __an object containing list of session_fields__ instead.

For example, the value of `games_played` for the first session collected is accessed as:

```python
source.games_played[0]
```

Instead of

```python
source[0].games_played.
```

The shape of `source` object therefore looks like this:

```json
{
  "source": {
    "session_id": ["915D", "T8KA"],
    "games_played": ["2", "1"],
    "games_won": ["2", "1"]
  }
}
```

Within expressions you can use any Python function applicable to lists, such as `len(source.session_id)` `sum(source.games_played)` or even more complex operations like

```python
sum([i for i in source.games_played if i >= 2])
```

## 4. Previewing the transformation using Blurr CLI

We can preview the result of the transformation using `blurr transform` command.

To preview a window transformation we need to pass both the Streaming and Window DTC as arguments:

```bash
$ blurr transform --streaming-dtc sessions-dtc.yml --window-dtc boost-dtc.yml events.log

["09C1", [{"last_7_days.avg_games_per_session": "4.82", "next_3_days.avg_games_per_session": "5.61"}]]
["B6FA", [{"last_7_days.avg_games_per_session": "2.73", "next_3_days.avg_games_per_session": "3.09"}]]
["NV9T", [{"last_7_days.avg_games_per_session": "8.11", "next_3_days.avg_games_per_session": "12.52"}]]
["6CF3", [{"last_7_days.avg_games_per_session": "9.89", "next_3_days.avg_games_per_session": "1"}]]
```

Each entry consists of an array with 2 items:

* `user_id`, the __Identity__ from the Streaming DTC.
* An object with the remaining values of the record.
